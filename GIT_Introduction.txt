What is GIT?

Git is a version control software/system for tracking changes in computer file

- Distributed version control - where developers dont need to be on same network to check in or check out changes
- Coordinates work between mutltiple developers
- Who made changes when and what
- Can revert changes as long changes are committed
- Local repos and Remote repos, dont need network or internet connection to work on local repos

Concepts on GIT

- Keeps track of code history
- takes snapshots of your files once you commit
- you can stage files before commit

Basic commands 

git init Initialize Local git repository and it creates .git file which is hidden
git add <file> adds the file to staging area
git status check status of working tree and staging area
git commit - commits changes in staging area to local repository
git push - push the local repo to remote repos,will ask for password, you can use ssh key to avoid entering
           passwords each time
git pull - Pull the latest from remote repos to local folder
git clone - copy remote repo to local dir

Demo:
To intialize a git repository use the command
$git init

It will go ahead and initialize the repo with .git folder which is hidden

Add username and email while working with git for identification purpose

git config --global user.name 'Dhana Mani'
git config --gloabal user.email 'Dhana.Mani@hotmail.co.uk'

To add file to staging use
git add filename

To check status of the file
git status

To remove file from staging use

git rm --cached inedx.html

git add . to add all files in repos

git commit opens up vim editor use i to insert, use esc :wq to come out of vm.

use git commit -m 'Comment'

To ignore a file 

touch .gitignore to create the file and inside the file add the file names to ignore

Branches:
To create a branch
git branch branchname

To switch to the branch
git checkout branchname

To merge changes 
git merge branchname

Clone to remote repo:

git remote - will give list of remote repository

git remote add origin https://github.com/DhanaMani1983/GIT.git

git push -u origin master to push to remote repos
