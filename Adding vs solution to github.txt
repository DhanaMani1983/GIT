4. Connect to team project, we are now going to create a clone, copy the https address from git hub repo and clone it to visual studio

Once you have cloned local repository to GIT repo, Next create a solution, make sure you turn off add to solution 

Always build and run the solution before checking in. 

Next go to team explorere and click on changes, you will see list of changes to include. put in a commit message and click commit which commits to local machine##

Go to unsynced commits, for best practice, dont break the build, before pushing pull the code and finally when you are ready push the code to the repo
